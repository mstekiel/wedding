# Development story
- Language handling is still beyond me. although there is two ways, put each lanuage in respective folder ['en','pl','it'] it does not compile ccording to my expectations so I putit in other format with each file copied with extension '*.en.md' for each language
- I read how to adjust the css file on your own based on this post `https://www.banjocode.com/post/hugo/custom-css`. It feels weird. Maybe its better to import the style completely into your project, with proper acknowledgement of the author.
